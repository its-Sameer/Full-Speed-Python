Parity is a term to express if a given integer is even or odd.

Problem Statement#
Given a checkParity(n) function, write code to determine if a given number n is even or odd. Think of this as a function that returns 0 if the number is even,
and 1 if it is odd. You have been given some starter code where the function and return statement have already been written, 
so donâ€™t worry about any Python-specific details about functions; just implement the function logic!

Input#
A number

Output#
The parity of the number

Sample Input#
4
